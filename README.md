## Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to help myself to open a Surf n' Shake shop serving
surfboards and ice cream to locals, tourists, and myself. And I will need real
investor backing to get this off the ground. And I will need to consider the
weather analysis where I will open the shop in the Oahu.

## Results
- June

- December

- From the two dataframes we get from June and December, we can see the first
  - difference is that the minimum temperature in June is 64 and the minimum
  - temperature in December in is 56, so December is probably colder
  - which may cause less consumers to visit the shop/
- Average temperature in June is also greater than December
- The standard deviation of temperature in June is smaller means smaller variation.

## Summary

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Above all the statistic we get from the four queries, we see that December is colder
and tends to have lower temperature, and temperature temperature in June has little
temperature variation. Moreover, June tends to have more precipitation than December.
By analyzing these data, I predict that there will have more consumers to visit the
shop during June since the weather is much warmer and more precipitation since the shop
is for surfing and ice cream.
